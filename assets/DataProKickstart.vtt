<v ->Hi, I'm Ben Sullins, a lifelong data geek.</v>

2
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.390
And, I wanna welcome you to this course,

3
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.880
the Data Professional Kickstart mini course.

4
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.920
It's a free course that is a sample

5
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.780
of the program I have going on at Free the Data Academy.

6
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.580
The whole idea is to take what I learned

7
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.870
over my two-decade-long span in data,

8
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.100
from low-level entry analyst, to chief data officer,

9
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.220
and distill that and give you the skills necessary

10
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.750
to rise to the top.

11
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.030
Throughout my time, there were some key traits

12
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.800
and some key features that I saw

13
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.790
from people that really just succeeded

14
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.530
and thrived in this field, to those that struggled

15
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.070
and had to find work elsewhere.

16
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.160
So, that's what the whole program is about,

17
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.890
this is just a small sample of that,

18
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.170
but one that I hope you find value in.

19
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.823
So sign up down below, and don't forget,

20
00:00:42.823 --> 00:00:45.230
when you free the data, your mind will follow.

21
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.873
I'll see you guys back here soon.
