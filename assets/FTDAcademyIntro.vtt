<v ->Welcome to the Free the Data Academy,</v>

2
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.080
I'm Ben, I'm sure you knew that by now.

3
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.600
And I just wanna run through

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.440
exactly what this program entails

5
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.670
so you know before signing up what to expect.

6
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.353
So first off, this program is designed for you

7
00:00:13.353 --> 00:00:16.440
to develop the key skills necessary

8
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.850
to succeed in the field of data.

9
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.600
In my almost two decades long span in this field,

10
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.850
I was able to discern, and train, and develop

11
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.620
so many people, and help them go from

12
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.230
an entry level position into directory level and above.

13
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.640
And it wasn't the technical stuff

14
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.920
that really made the difference,

15
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.130
and so most of what you're gonna find here

16
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.530
is non-technical, which is good because

17
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.360
these skills, you'll learn them now,

18
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.630
and they will serve you over many many years to come.

19
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.550
So, first off, level one,

20
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.930
this is the basics, everybody needs to go through this.

21
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.619
We cover all the concepts and everything behind

22
00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:56.500
how data came to be what it is today,

23
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.280
how the different aspects work,

24
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.880
from organizations and how to work with customers,

25
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.919
to presenting information and even a little bit

26
00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:06.300
of the technical stuff with the sequel section.

27
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.060
Now this is really great if you're brand new

28
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.058
and honestly even if you're a seasoned veteran,

29
00:01:10.058 --> 00:01:12.000
I highly recommend this,

30
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.010
and from there if you want to go into the next level,

31
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.590
I show you in the tech foundations course

32
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.440
all the different kind of popular languages

33
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.440
and tools out there in the field of data now,

34
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.490
and I give you concrete examples that you can use

35
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.850
to either showcase this new skill you had,

36
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.730
to a peer or maybe a job you're trying to interview for,

37
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.910
and then after that, I take it to the interviewing side,

38
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.700
so if you're looking to actually interview for a job,

39
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.230
you can take what you learned

40
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.150
in the technical skills section

41
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.940
and make those demos and bring them to people.

42
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.030
And I show you everything that I know,

43
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.000
from being someone that interviewed at places,

44
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.550
to being a hiring manager,

45
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.310
having interviewed over hundreds of people.

46
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.000
So all that combined is what this program is,

47
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.650
and the main idea is that these skills

48
00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.720
will be with you for years to come,

49
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.400
and help you achieve all the kind of success

50
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.030
and really make the impact

51
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.490
that you want to make using data.

52
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.280
So check out more info below,

53
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.700
and I wish you the best

54
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.553
and hope to see you on the inside.
